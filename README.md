# xgb_predict
It is used to predict xgboost model score based on the model input decision tree such as that generated by Skit_Learn xgb.train
Note: the model can not be used for the xgb.fit generated decision tree 
Flow chart:
class Tree: Read the decision tree information -> cached into a list of tree root nodes (each nodel represents the root of a tree)-> build into a full binary tree
Class probability: caclulate the probability of each tree and accumulate for a single instance.
